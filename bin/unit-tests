# This ensures that the logic in the VIP sniffs is correct,
# by running them against the .inc files in /tests.
#
# EXAMPLE TO RUN LOCALLY:
#
#   ./bin/unit-tests
#
# The script allows to pass additional PHPUnit CLI arguments.
# For instance, if you only want to run the tests for one particular sniff,
# use the following, replacing "SniffName" with the name of the target sniff:
#
#   ./bin/unit-tests --filter SniffName
#

"$(pwd)/vendor/bin/phpunit" --filter WordPressVIPMinimum "$(pwd)/vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/tests/AllTests.php" --no-coverage $@
