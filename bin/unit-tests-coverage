# Run the unit tests with code coverage.
#
# This ensures that the logic in the VIP sniffs is covered by unit tests.
#
# EXAMPLE TO RUN LOCALLY:
#
#   ./bin/unit-tests-coverage
#
# The script allows to pass additional PHPUnit CLI arguments.
# For instance, if you only want to run the tests with code coverage for one
# particular sniff, use the following, replacing "SniffName" with the name
# of the target sniff:
#
#   ./bin/unit-tests-coverage --filter SniffName
#

"$(pwd)/vendor/bin/phpunit" --filter WordPressVIPMinimum "$(pwd)/vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/tests/AllTests.php" $@
