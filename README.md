# VIP-Coding-Standards
This project maintains the minimum ruleset of [PHP_CodeSniffer rules](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) (sniffs) to validate code developed for [WordPress.com VIP](https://vip.wordpress.com/).

The ruleset contains only the rules which are considered being "blockers" according to the [WordPress.com VIP documentation](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/code-review-what-we-look-for/)

The ruleset takes advantage of existing rules in the [WordPress-Coding-Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) project.
